with JavaFX, features a graphical user interface where 
two players take turns dropping colored discs into a

employs the Minimax algorithm for the AI player, 
ensuring strategic decision-making. There are two players one is a human and another one is the computer. Any player can start the game. After starting the game if any player can connect 4 coins in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally he will win the game otherwise game will be drawn.
